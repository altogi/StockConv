# StockConv

## Operating Principle
This project implements a method of algorithmic trading or time series prediction based on the conversion of time series data into a binary image. Based on the binary images of several share prices (or any combination of temporal trends), one can train a Convolutional Neural Network to predict, after a certain prediction time \\(T_{prediction}\\), whether the price of one of them has risen or fallen.
